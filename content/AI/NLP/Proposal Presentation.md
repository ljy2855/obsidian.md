### Goals
- The main goal of this project is to understand the mechanism of recent large language models and related tasks. Then, formalize your own research questions and conduct experiments.
- There are _**two types**_ of project tracks:
    - **Undergraduate track**
        - This track for those who are taking _CSEG321_
        - You will firstly train GPT-2 by yourself based on given skeleton codes.
        - Additionally, you will set your own research questions or downstream tasks with different datasets, and then explore it.

- **Step 1. Train GPT-2 by your own hands.**
    - In this project, **students implement parts of the GPT-2 architecture and use it to tackle 3 downstream tasks**. Similar to previous years, the code is in PyTorch.
        
        - The three downstream tasks: Sentiment Analysis, Paraphrase Detection, and Sonnet Generation.
    - Please refer the document `CS224n: Default Final Project: Build GPT-2`

    - The skeleton code is given at [https://github.com/cfifty/public_cs224n_gpt](https://github.com/cfifty/public_cs224n_gpt)
        
        - Clone the project GitHub repository and implement it with own your hands.
        - _There are several empty sections that need to be completed._
    - As for the GPU machines,
        
        - Please use Colab or Google Cloud Platform.
            - If you need additional help, please contact TAs.
        - Develop your code your local machine, using PyTorch without GPUs, and move to your Colab or GCP only after you’ve debugged your code and are ready to train. You can use a private GitHub repository to manage your codebase and sync files between the machines and teammates.
    
- **Step 2. Additionally, you will set your own research questions or downstream tasks with different datasets, and then explore it.**
    - You can set small research questions, but let’s do creative and critical thinking!
    - What is your hypothesis? And how will you set up the experiment setting to show your hypothesis?
    - It’s okay if you fail to verify it. If your results does not look good, then let’s find the reasons.
    - Some example research questions:
        - How to improve the downstream task performance?
        - How to extend Korean downstream tasks?
        - Please also refer to Sec 7.4 of the above instruction document and discussion questions in our class.

## 5-minute Team Presentations

Each team should include the following **4 components** in their proposal presentation:

1. **Problem Statement**
    - What is the problem you're trying to solve?
    - Why is this problem important? (real-world application, social value, etc.)
2. **Proposed Approach**
    - What is your strategy to solve the problem?
    - Which model, technique, or methodology will you use?
3. **Data & Resources**
    - What dataset will you use?
    - Any plans for data collection or preprocessing?
4. **Execution Plan & Expected Outcomes**
    - Key milestones, task distribution, and timeline
    - What are your expected outcomes?
    - How will you measure success?

### Evaluation Criteria

Based on a 10-point scale (weights can be adjusted):

| Criteria                      | Description                                                               | Points |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Clarity of Problem Definition | Is the problem well-defined and relevant?                                 | 2 pts  |
| Appropriateness & Creativity  | Is the proposed approach suitable and does it show creativity?            | 3 pts  |
| Feasibility                   | Is the project feasible given the timeframe, team, and data availability? | 2 pts  |
| Presentation Quality          | Is the presentation clear, within the time limit, and well-structured?    | 2 pts  |
| Outcome & Evaluation Plan     | Are the expected results and evaluation methods clearly stated?           | 1 pt   |
